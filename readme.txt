== Description ==

WP Soundsystem is a complete solution to manage a music library within Wordpress.  Use it to build or import playlists, manage tracks and audio sources, albums, artists, and play them with our audio player.  The perfect fit for a music blog !

= Custom Post Types =

Several new post types will be available : Playlists, Radios, Artists, Albums, Tracks and Sources.

= Playlists =

Creating and editing playlists is a piece of cake using the *Tracklist Importer*:
Add or remove tracks on the fly, reorder them, and link one or several music sources to each track.

Frontend, playlists can be favorited and exported by your users.

= Tracks =

When editing a track, you can retrieve details from other music services like [MusicBrainz](https://musicbrainz.org/) or [Spotify](https://musicbrainz.org/).
You can attach audio sources to your tracks with the **Track sources** metabox.
Track can be favorited by your users frontend, or added to any new playlist on-the-fly.

= Sources =

You can attach several audio sources to any track.  It can be a link to an audio file, a Soundcloud or Youtube URL, etc.  The player will then try to play them.

= Radios =

Radios are how we call live playlists.  Those playlists are synced with remote webpages or services, and are refreshed seamlessly after a short delay.  Popular services are supported out-of-the-box (Spotify, Last.fm, Radionomy, Deezer, BBC, Soundcloud, Soundsgood, Hype Machine, Indie Shuffle, RadioKing,...), and you can use the **Tracklist Importer** metabox to try your own setup.

= Tracklist Importer (requires an API key) =

Backup your playlists using the Tracklist Importer Metabox.  Popular services only need the playlist URL !
You can also setup your own configuration, if you are somewhat familiar with [jQuery selectors](http://www.w3schools.com/jquery/jquery_ref_selectors.asp).

= Autosource (requires an API key) =

If you don't attach sources to your track manually, you can enable the autosource in the plugin settings.  
It will search remote sources (Youtube, Soundcloud...) and try to play them.

= Last.fm =

The audio player can **scrobble** tracks to your Last.fm account.
When the scrobbler is enabled, every track favorited by a user connected on Last.fm will also be loved on that service.

= BuddyPress =

This plugin is BuddyPress ready, and supports a new "music" section that lists the user favorite tracks and tracklists, and the ones he created.
It will also enable new BuddyPress activity items.

= WP SoundSystem API =

Get more out of this plugin by [registering an API key](https://api.spiff-radio.org/?p=10); which will enable the Tracklist Importer, the Autosource module, and the Radios post type.

Without an API key, the plugin still is very complete; but consider it as a nice way to support the work done - hundred of hours - for this plugin, and to ensure its durability.

= Donate =
It truly took me a of time to code this plugin.
If you like it, please consider [making a donation](https://api.spiff-radio.org/?p=31).

This would be very appreciated â€” Thanks !

== Installation ==

This plugin requires PHP Version 5.4 or later.

1. Upload the plugin to your blog and Activate it.
2.  Go to the settings page and setup the plugin.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

== How can I embed a track or a playlist in a post ? =

Using shortcodes:

`[wpsstm-track post_id="150"]`

`[wpsstm-tracklist post_id="160"]`

Or directly with PHP functions:

`<?php
$tracklist = new WPSSTM_Post_Tracklist(); //optionally accepts a post_id as argument
echo $tracklist->get_tracklist_html();
?>`

= What is the community user ? =

The community user is a Wordpress user you need to create, and that will be assigned as author to the content created automatically by the plugin, for instance imported tracks or sources.
